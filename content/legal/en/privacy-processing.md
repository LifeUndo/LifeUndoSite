# Data Processing Policy (summary)

The Software "GetLifeUndo" works locally; no telemetry, and timeline content or browsing history are not uploaded to servers. On the {{COMPANY_SITE}} backend we process account data (e-mail), device identifiers and license / 7-day trial status, as well as minimal payment data required by the payment provider. Support inquiries may process e-mail. Data subject rights are implemented upon request to {{COMPANY_EMAIL}}. Full terms — in DPA: {{COMPANY_SITE}}/en/legal/dpa.
